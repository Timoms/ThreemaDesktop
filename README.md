# ThreemaDesktop
Simple CefSharp Wrapper for Threema-Web including desktop-notifications.

This project uses CefSharp (https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp) to emulate the Threema-Web Messenger in a program.
It uses website-title events to inform you about new messages (currently there are no CefSharp Notifications available).
